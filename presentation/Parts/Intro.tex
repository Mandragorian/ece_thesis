  Instant messaging with two participants is solved!
  Why are group chats not encrypted already?!\\[0.3cm]

  Answer:

  Because we still can't solve every problem at once! So we have to choose.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

  Here are some problems to choose from:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Chatroom Message Consistency
    \item Room Moderation
    \item Offline messages but with a group secret
  \end{itemize}

  \vfill

  We can't solve all these problems together. But we can solve some of them.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  This is what our implementation provides:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality
    \item Authentication
    \item Forward Secrecy
    \item Deniable participation in chatroom
    \item Deniable authoring of messages
    \item Partial Transcript Consistency
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
These properties are well known in the crypto community.
\vfill
Except for Transcript Consistency!

So let's have a word about it.

  And now let's see what we did.
