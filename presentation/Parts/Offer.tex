\begin{frame}
  This subprotocol does two things simultaneously.
  \vfill
  First the initiator makes an offer to other participants to start a session.
  \vfill
  Secondly, it generates a unique session ID for this run of the protocol.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  The problem: Messages from one chatroom should not be valid in another chatroom.
  \vfill
  The solution: Create a (with high probability) unique session id. This way any signatures will not be valid in other chatrooms.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  To achieve that, each user $A$ generates a random number $c_A$, called the contribution.
  \vfill
  She then transmits her contribution to everyone else in the chatroom.
  \vfill
  She calculates the session id when she has received the contributions from all other users.
  \[
      sess_{id} = H(c_A || c_B || \dots || c_Z)
  \]
  \vfill
  $sess_{id}$ is not authenticated, but we fix that later.
\end{frame}
