  During Attest participants verify that they all agree on $sid_i$ and $\mathcal{S}$.
  \vfill
  Messages exchanged for the calculation of $sid_i$ were not signed, since $sid_i$ is required before $\mathcal{S}$ is constructed.
  \vfill
  Participants must verify that they all have the same view of $\mathcal{S}$.\\[0.3cm]
  \vfill
  Any information transmitted is signed using the association table $\mathcal{S}$, so it is:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Authenticated
    \item Deniable
  \end{itemize}

  Each participant calculates the SHA-512 hash of $\mathcal{S}$, sorted in lexicographical order according to each participant's username.
  \vfill
  Then, broadcasts a message containing this hash and the value of $sid_i$.
  \vfill
  Provided that SHA-512 is a cryptographic hash function an attacker cannot find two signing keys association tables with the same hash.
  \vfill
  By signing the message containing the specific $sid_i$ , a user implicitly verifies that he is using that particular id for this session.
