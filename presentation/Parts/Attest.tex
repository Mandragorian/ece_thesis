  During Attest participants verify that they all agree on $sid_i$ and $\mathcal{S}$.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Messages exchanged for the calculation of $sid_i$ were not signed, since $sid_i$ is required before $\mathcal{S}$ is constructed.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Participants must verify that they all have the same view of $\mathcal{S}$.\\[0.3cm]

  Any information transmitted is signed using the association table $\mathcal{S}$, so it is:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Authenticated
    \item Deniable
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Each participant calculates the SHA-512 hash of $\mathcal{S}$, sorted in lexicographical order according to each participant's username.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Then, broadcasts a message containing this hash and the value of $sid_i$.
  
  The first participant sends a list containing the shared base and the shared base raised to his private exponent.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Provided that SHA-512 is a cryptographic hash function an attacker cannot find two signing keys association tables with the same hash.
  
  by signing the message containing the specific $sid_i$ , a user implicitly verifies that he is using that particular id for this session.
