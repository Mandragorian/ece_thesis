  This is how the actual communication between participants is perfmormed.\\[0.3cm]

  Participants exchange authenticated and encrypted messages using the association table $\mathcal{S}$ derived from DSKE and the shared key $\mathcal{K}$ derived from GKA.\\[0.3cm]
  
  A transcript of the chatroom is stored, that will be used later to check the chat room transcript consistency.

  We use public key encryption methods. Symmetric algorithms would require to mac the message n-1 times.\\[0.3cm]

  Signature generation is the last step before sending a message. All metadata, like $sid_i$, are signed. See, Cryptographic Doom Principle.\\[0.3cm]

  Symmetrically, signature verification is done before any other operation is performed on a received message.

  $\mathcal{K}$ cannot be directly used as an encryption key. If two users sent a message at the same time, they would use the same counter. This would be a catastrophic failure.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Instead, $\mathcal{K}$ is used as a master key, from which personal encryption keys are derived.\\[0.3cm]

  \frametitle{Communication - Encryption (2/2)}
Personal encryption key is derived from $\mathcal{K}$ and the participant's id $id_{personal}$:
\[ k_{enc} = H(id_{personal} || \mathcal{K}) \]\\[0.3cm]

  Each participant stores locally his personal upper half (8 bytes) of the counter, $ctr$. The top half of the counter is prepended in the sent message. The ciphertext is produced as follows:
\[ ciphertext = AES_{CTR}(k_{enc}, ctr||0, plaintext) \]\\[0.3cm] 
  
  To decrypt a message, a user first calculates the decryption key:
  \[ k_{dec} = H(id_{sender} || \mathcal{K}) \]\\[0.3cm]

  He uses $k_{dec}$ and the prepended top half of the counter ctr, to get the plaintext:
  \[ plaintext = AES_{CTR}(k_{dec}, ctr||0, ciphertext) \]

  \frametitle{Communication - Transcript}
  A seperate transcript is held for the messages of each participant.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Each transcript is a link list, kept sorted in lexicographical order according to the message content.\\[0.3cm]
  
  Messages are inserted to the corresponding list, each time a participant receives or sends a message during Communication.
