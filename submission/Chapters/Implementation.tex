\section{Summary}

Our primary goal was to design and implement the protocol we specified as a production-grade software, aiming to meet the needs of a wide user base. Of course every user would expect such a software to offer privacy in communication between two parties too. That said, implementing mpOTR as part of the OTR library was a natural decision. Not only would this result in a complete IM privacy library, but it would, as well, affect an already existing wide user base.

There exist quite a few implementations of the OTR library, but only two of them have been actually developed by the OTR Development Team. The first one is implemented in C, it's the very first implementation and the most actively developed and has 4 major versions with latest release in March of 2016. The other one is implemented in Java, and has only one release in October of 2009.
